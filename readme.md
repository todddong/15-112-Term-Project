Project Name: AI Wordle Blitz

Description: 
This game features both a traditional Wordle as well as a computer Wordle racing
mode. The traditional mode is a clone of the real Wordle, with the same colors
and gameplay. In the computer mode, the user chooses the difficulty of computer 
to play against. The levels vary in guessing efficiency and algorithms. Guessing 
turns alternate, and whenever it is the user's turn, they must guess within 30 
seconds or they will lose. Additionally, hints and advanced hints will be 
available for the user. The hint button generates a word out of a list of the 
most helpful words for Wordle. The advanced hint button generates a helpful word 
based on the user's previous guesses to make a very useful hint. A pause button
is also available if the user needs it to stop the timer. While the traditional
mode is limited to 6 guesses like the real Wordle, the computer mode includes
infinite turns until the user wins or loses. Because of this, a scrolling 
feature is included by using the up and down arrow keys so the user can see 
previous guesses. The impossible difficulty includes no hints, pausing, or 
computer board word coloring. Guessing invalid words will trigger a message to 
pop up.
